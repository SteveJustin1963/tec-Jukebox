A jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device, usually a coin-operated machine, that will play a patron's selection from self-contained media.
Who invented the jukebox in 1920? In 1918, Hobart C. Niblack created a device that automatically changed records, leading to one of the first selective jukeboxes being introduced in 1927 by the Automated Musical Instrument Company. It wasn't until 1937 that the music-playing machines began to be called “jukeboxes.” The origin of the name is believed to be derived from the word “jook” (other spellings include “jouk,” “juke,” and “jute”), which was used as a slang term for dancing and acting wildly or disorderly.
